# [WhiteFlyCounter ](http://air.ug/mcrops/) : An AI Android project to automatically count the number of whiftely on a leaf 

## About ?

###Mcrops project aims to develop diagnostic tools for diagnosing viral crop diseases in cassava crops. This is a description of a research project being undertaken by the AI-DEV research group at the School of Com- puting and IT. We present several methodologies based on cutting edge crop surveillance techniques. These include smart-phone enabled field based diagnosis of plant diseases, the use of spectrometry techniques in performing non-invasive diagnosis of disease in asymptomatic crops as well as spatial temporal models for disease spread and incidence. The overall goal of the project is to improve the livelihoods of small-holder cassava farmers by enhancing crop yield through the application of these techniques..
